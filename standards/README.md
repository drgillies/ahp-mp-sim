# Standards

This directory defines the working standards for the project.

## Documents

- `project-standards.md`: Planning, scope, documentation, and delivery expectations.
- `git-standards.md`: Branching, commits, pull requests, and release hygiene.
- `code-standards.md`: Python coding conventions, testing, and quality gates.

## How To Use

1. Read all three documents before starting implementation work.
2. Treat standards as default unless a task explicitly documents an exception.
3. Update standards in the same PR when introducing new conventions.

## Tooling Baseline

- Use `uv` as the default tool for Python environments, dependency installation, and command execution.
